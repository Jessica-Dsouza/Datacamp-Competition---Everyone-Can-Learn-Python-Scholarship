## üìñ Background
The first "Everyone Can Learn Python" Scholarship from DataCamp is now open for entries. 

The challenges below test the Python and SQL skills you gained from Introduction to Python and Introduction to SQL and pair them with your existing problem-solving and creative thinking.

The scholarship is open to people who have completed or are completing their secondary education and are preparing to pursue a degree in computer science or data science. Students preparing for graduate-level computer science or data science degrees are also welcome to apply.

‚ÑπÔ∏è Introduction to Data Science Notebooks
You can skip this section if you are already familiar with data science notebooks.

Data science notebooks
A data science notebook is a document containing text cells (what you're reading now) and code cells. What is unique with a notebook is that it's interactive: You can change or add code cells and then run a cell by selecting it and then clicking the Run button to the right ( ‚ñ∂, or Run All on top) or hitting control + enter.

The result will be displayed directly in the notebook.

Try running the Python cell below:

# Run this cell to see the result (click on Run on the right, or control+enter)
100 * 1.75 * 20
3500.0
Modify any of the numbers and rerun the cell.

You can add a Markdown, Python, or SQL cell by clicking on the Add Markdown, Add Code, and Add SQL buttons that appear as you move the mouse pointer near the bottom of any cell.

Here at DataCamp, we call our interactive notebook Workspace. You can find out more about Workspace here.

A note on SQL
You can click the "Browse tables" button in the upper right-hand corner of the SQL cell below to view the available tables. They will show on the left of the notebook.

It is also important to note that the database used in this challenge is a slightly different version (SQL Server) from the one used in the Introduction to SQL course (PostgreSQL). You might notice that the keyword LIMIT does not exist in SQL Server.

‚úÖ Checklist before publishing and submitting to the competition
Rename your workspace to make it descriptive of your work. N.B. you should leave the notebook name as notebook.ipynb.
Remove redundant cells like the judging criteria, so the workbook is focused on your story.
Make sure the workspace reads well.
Pay attention to the judging criteria.
Check that all the cells run without error.
‚åõÔ∏è Time is ticking. Good luck!
